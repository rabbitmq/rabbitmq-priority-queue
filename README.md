# Nothing to see here

As of RabbitMQ 3.5.0 the priority queue is integrated into the
broker; the plugin is no longer needed.

Users of the plugin upgrading from previous versions of RabbitMQ should:

* Install the new version of RabbitMQ
* Invoke: `rabbitmq-plugins disable rabbitmq_priority_queue`
* Start the server
